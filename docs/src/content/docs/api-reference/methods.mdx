import { Code, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The HTTP client provides the following methods:

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

### GET

```ts
import { GET } from "@kristall/http";
```

Get method is used to fetch some data to the backend.

```ts
const GET = <T>(url: `/${string}`, options?: FetchOptions) => Promise<ServerResponse<T>>;
```

#### Parameters

- url: URL to fetch
- options: [FetchOptions](#fetchoptions)
    - **tags**: Tag array to help NextJS cache
    - **cache**: NextJS cache value **(default: no-store)** 

#### Returns

GET return a [ServerResponse](#serverresponse) promise.

#### Usage

export const GET = `
import { GET } from "@kristall/http";

import type { Product } from "../interfaces";
import { PRODUCTS_TAGS } from "../constants";

export const getProducts = async (): Promise<Product[] | null> => {
    const { data } = await GET<Product[] | null>("/products", {
        tags: [PRODUCTS_TAGS.GET],
        cache: "force-cache",
    });
    return data;
};
`

<Code code={GET} lang='ts' title='products/get.ts' />

#### Caching

To properly cache the GET request, you need to pass the **tags** option.

```ts
const response = GET<Product[]>('/products', {
    tags: [PRODUCTS_TAGS.GET]
});
```

<Aside type='caution'>
    Since NextJS 15, cache is set by default to **no-store**. To effectively cache the request, you need to pass the **cache** option with the value **force-cache**.
</Aside>

So the request will be cached by NextJS and can be revalidated after a mutation.

```ts
await uploadProduct(product);
revalidateTag(PRODUCTS_TAGS.GET);
```

<Aside type="caution">
If the tags array is empty, the request will not be cached. And will show a warning in the development console.
```sh
⚠️ No tags provided for GET request: /products
```

</Aside>

By default, the GET method uses the NextJS cache value **no-store**. 
You can change it by passing the **cache** option.

**RECOMMENDED**

```ts
const response = GET<Product[]>('/products', {
    cache: 'force-cache'
});
```

or the revalidate option.

```ts
const response = GET<Product[]>('/products', {
    revalidate: 3600
});
```

<Aside>
**Kristall** was built with **cache** set as **force-cache** before NextJS 15. But after some troubleshooting with cache, we decided to change it to **no-store** by default according to the NextJS documentation.
</Aside>

#### Typescript

It receives one type parameter, the type of the response data.

```ts
const response = await GET<Product[]>('/products');
// Typescript will infer the type of the response data. 
// In this case, it's an array of products.
const { data } = response;
```

#### Errors

If the request fails, the method will return a [ServerResponse](#serverresponse) with the error message and the data will be **null**.

GET method will log on develop console if the request fails.
```sh
❌ Error fetching data at:  /products
```

### POST

```ts
import { POST } from "@kristall/http";
```

POST method is used to send data to the backend.

```ts
const POST = <T, R = unknown>(url: `/${string}`, body: T) => Promise<ServerResponse<R>>;
```

#### Parameters

- url: URL to fetch
- body: Data to send


#### Returns

POST return a [ServerResponse](#serverresponse) promise.

#### Usage

export const POST = `
import { POST } from "@kristall/http";

import type { Product } from "../interfaces";
import { PRODUCTS_TAGS } from "../constants";

export const uploadProduct = async (_prevState: unknown, payload: FormData): Promise<void> => {
    const data = Object.fromEntries(payload.entries());
    
    await POST<Product, Product>("/products", data);
    revalidateTag(PRODUCTS_TAGS.GET);

    return;
};
`

<Code code={POST} lang='ts' title='products/upload.ts' />

#### Typescript

It receives two type parameters, the first one is type **payload** data and the second one is the type of the **response** data.

export const TYPESCRIPT_POST = `
const data = {...} as Product
// ✅ we tell typescript that the payload is a Product and its all fine!
const productResponse = await POST<Product, Product | null>('/products', data);

// ❌ this will throw an error typing since the payload 
// is not the same type as we declared in the POST method
const orderResponse = await POST<Order>('/orders', data);
`

<Code code={TYPESCRIPT_POST} lang='ts' mark={['Order']} />

#### Errors

If the request fails, the method will return a [ServerResponse](#serverresponse) with the error message and the data will be **null**.

POST method will log on develop console if the request fails.
```sh
❌ Error pushing data at: /products
```

If no payload is provided to the POST method, the request will continue but a
warning will be logged on develop console.

```sh
⚠️ No data provided for POST request: /products
```

### PUT/PATCH

```ts
import { PUT, PATCH } from "@kristall/http";
```

PUT/PATCH method is used to update data to the backend. Both methods use the same API, also like POST.

```ts
const PUT = <T, R = unknown>(url: `/${string}`, body: T) => Promise<ServerResponse<R>>;
const PATCH = <T, R = unknown>(url: `/${string}`, body: T) => Promise<ServerResponse<R>>;
```

#### Parameters

- url: URL to fetch
- body: Data to send


#### Returns

PUT/PATCH return a [ServerResponse](#serverresponse) promise.

#### Usage

export const PUT = `
import { PUT } from "@kristall/http";

import type { Product } from "../interfaces";
import { PRODUCTS_TAGS } from "../constants";

export const updateProduct = async (_prevState: unknown, payload: FormData): Promise<void> => {
    const data = Object.fromEntries(payload.entries());
    
    await PUT<Product, Product>("/products", data);
    revalidateTag(PRODUCTS_TAGS.GET);

    return;
};
`

<Code code={PUT} lang='ts' title='products/updateProduct.ts' />

#### Typescript

It receives two type parameters, the first one is type **payload** data and the second one is the type of the **response** data.

export const TYPESCRIPT_PUT = `
const data = {...} as Product
// ✅ we tell typescript that the payload is a Product and its all fine!
const productResponse = await PUT<Product, Product | null>('/products', data);

// ❌ this will throw an error typing since the payload 
// is not the same type as we declared in the PUT/PATCH method
const orderResponse = await PATCH<Order>('/orders', data);
`

<Code code={TYPESCRIPT_PUT} lang='ts' mark={['Order']} />

#### Errors

If the request fails, the method will return a [ServerResponse](#serverresponse) with the error message and the data will be **null**.

PUT/PATCH method will log on develop console if the request fails.
```sh
❌ Error updating data at: /products
```

If no payload is provided to the PUT/PATCH method, the request will continue but a
warning will be logged on develop console.

```sh
⚠️ No data provided for PUT request: /products
```

### DELETE

```ts
import { DELETE } from "@kristall/http";
```

DELETE method is used to delete data to the backend.

```ts
const DELETE = (url: `/${string}`) => Promise<ServerResponse<null>>;
```

#### Parameters

- url: URL to hit


#### Returns

DELETE **ALWAYS** return a **null** [ServerResponse](#serverresponse) promise.

#### Usage

export const DELETE = `
import { DELETE } from "@kristall/http";

import { PRODUCTS_TAGS } from "../constants";

export const deleteProduct = async (_prevState: unknown, payload: FormData): Promise<void> => {
    const { _id } = Object.fromEntries(payload.entries());

    await DELETE(\`/products?id=\${_id}\`);
    revalidateTag(PRODUCTS_TAGS.GET);

    return;
};
`

<Code code={DELETE} lang='ts' title='products/deleteProduct.ts' />

#### Typescript

Its a simple method, so it doesn't receive any type parameters and the response data is always **null**.

export const TYPESCRIPT_DELETE = `
const productResponse = await DELETE(\`/products?id=\${_id}\`);
`

<Code code={TYPESCRIPT_DELETE} lang='ts' mark={['Order']} />

## Error handlings

All the HTTP methods are **error safe**, so if the request fails, the method will return a [ServerResponse](#serverresponse) with the error message and the data will be **null**.

```ts
// Failing request
const response = await GET<Product[] | null>('/productss');
// data will be null
const { data } = response
```

<Aside>
    The package takes as an error every response with status code between **400** and **599**.
</Aside>

### Troubleshooting

By default, HTTP methods not consider the data response as **null**, but data can be **null** if the request fails, even if the type was set as not nullable.
This is because an error of type definition that wasn't considered at the time the package was develop. And fixing it would be a breaking change for almost all the apps and requests.

So, we recommend to set also a nullable type definition for the data response property to avoid null errors that will break the app.

Use it like this:
```ts
// ✅ we tell typescript that data can be null and we can handle the error
const { data } = await GET<Product[] | null>('/products');
```
instead of:
```ts
// ⚠️ data will be null if the request fails and its not handled
const { data } = await GET<Product[]>('/products');
```

We are trying to figure out how tell typescript that the data can be null without breaking the app and without telling it explicitly.

## Typescript

### ServerResponse

All the HTTP methods response with an object with the following properties:

```ts
export interface ServerResponse<T> {
    message: string;
    data: T;
    status: number;
}
```

### FetchOptions

FetchOptions is an object that contains the options for the HTTP [GET](#get) method.

```ts
interface FetchOptions {
    tags: string[];
    cache?: RequestCache;
    revalidate?: false | 0 | number | undefined;
    /**
    * @deprecated
    */
    toJSON?: boolean;
    /**
    * @deprecated
    */
    safe?: boolean;
}
```

### Pagination

Pagination is an object that contains the pagination data for the [GET](#get) method. Its usage depends on the request.
Some request like `products` or `orders` will return a [Pagination](#pagination) object.

```ts
export interface Pagination<T> {
	entities: T[];
	next: number | null;
	previous: number | null;
	page: number;
	hasMore: boolean;
	totalPages: number;
}
```

Pagination can be used within the [ServerResponse](#serverresponse) object.

```ts
const response = await GET<Pagination<Product> | null>('/products');

const { data } = response;

if (!data) {
    return
}
const { entities, page, totalPages, hasMore, next, previous } = data;
```

The entity property will be automatically typed as an array because the nature of the request.

```ts
// ✅ typed correctly
const response = await GET<Pagination<Product>>('/products');

const { data } = response;

// products will be automatically typed as an array
const products = data?.entities.map(product => product.name);
```

export const INCORRECT_TYPE = `
// ❌ not typed correctly
const response = await GET<Pagination<Product[]>>('/products');

const { data } = response

// will be an error typing
const products = data?.entities.map(product => product.name);
`

<Code code={INCORRECT_TYPE} lang='ts' mark={['[]', 'product.name']} />
