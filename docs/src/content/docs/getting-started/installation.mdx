description: A quick guide to get started with @kristall/http.

import { Tabs, TabItem, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

**@kristall/http** is a package for Kristall that provides a simple HTTP client.
It's built on top of **fetch** API based on NextJS [**server actions**](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/fetching-data#with-the-fetch-api).

### Why its different from using raw fetch API?

**@kristall/http** is a wrapper for the fetch API, so it handles more things than just the requests, E.g:

- Type safety.
    - Add consistent types for every response.
- Automatically: 
    - Adds the **Authorization/Cookie** header with the actual session cookie.
    - Adds the **Content-Type** header with the **application/json** value.
    - Converts the request body into a string before sending it.
- Handles error responses.
- Helps NextJS cache.
    - With the **tags** and **cache** options, we can improve user experience and reduce the number of requests, taking control of the app's cache.


## Installation

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @kristall/http
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @kristall/http
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @kristall/http
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# The base URL of your API
SERVER_API=http://localhost:3000
```

## Basic usage

export const GET = `
"use server";

import { GET } from "@kristall/http";

import type { Product } from "../interfaces";
import { PRODUCTS_TAGS } from "../constants";

export const getProducts = async (): Promise<Product[] | null> => {
    const { data } = await GET<Product[] | null>("/products", {
        tags: [PRODUCTS_TAGS.GET],
        cache: "force-cache",
    });
    return data;
};
`

<Code code={GET} lang='ts' title='products/get.ts' />
